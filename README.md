# Quote Generator Microservice

# Instructions:

- I've created a simple command line UI for demonstration
- This UI will ask for user input in the form of a positive integer
- User will enter a positive integer and the UI will write this to quote-service.txt
- quote-service.py will then read that text file and select from a list of quotes
- the number read corresponds to the index of the list
- quote-service.py then writes that quote to quote-service.txt
- The UI will then read quote-service.txt and display the quote to the user.
